Q1. (Maximum element in ArrayList) Write the following method that returns the     
maximum value in an ArrayList of integers. The method returns null if the      
list is null or the list size is 0.                                            
 public static Integer max(ArrayList<Integer> list)                             
 Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a sequence of numbers      
 ending with 0, and invokes this method to return the largest number in the     
 input. 

Q2. (Use ArrayList) Write a program that creates an ArrayList and adds a Loan    
object, a Date object, a string, and a Circle object to the list, and use a    
 loop to display all the elements in the list by invoking the objectâ€™s toString() method.

Q3. (Implement MyStack using inheritance) In Listing 11.10, MyStack is implemented 
using composition. Define a new stack class that extends ArrayList.            
 Write a test program that prompts the user to enter five strings and displays them in       
 reverse order.    

Q4. (Sort ArrayList) Write the following method that sorts an ArrayList of numbers:                                                                              *
	public static void sort(ArrayList<Integer> list)                               
 Write a test program that prompts the user to enter 5 numbers, stores them in  
 an array list, and displays them in increasing order. 

Q5.  (Remove duplicates) Write a method that removes the duplicate elements from    
 an array list of integers using the following header:                          
                                                                                
	 public static void removeDuplicate(ArrayList<Integer> list)                    
                                                                                
 Write a test program that prompts the user to enter 10 integers to a list and  
 displays the distinct integers separated by exactly one space.   

Q6. (Combine two lists) Write a method that returns the union of two array lists   
 of integers using the following header:                                        
                                                                                
 public static ArrayList<Integer> union(ArrayList<Integer> list1, ArrayList<Integer> list2)                            
                                                                                
 For example, the union of two array lists {2, 3, 1, 5} and {3, 4, 6} is        
 {2, 3, 1, 5, 3, 4, 6}. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two 
 lists, each with five integers, and displays their union. The numbers are      
 separated by exactly one space in the output.
