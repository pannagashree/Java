Q1: (Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit) Write a program that reads a Celsius degree in
a double value from the console, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the
result. The formula for the conversion is as follows:
fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32
Q2: (Compute the volume of a cylinder) Write a program that reads in the radius
and length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following
formulas:
area = radius * radius * pi
volume = area * length

Q3. (Financial application: calculate tips) Write a program that reads the subtotal
and the gratuity rate, then computes the gratuity and total. For example, if the
user enters 10 for subtotal and 15% for gratuity rate, the program displays $1.5
as gratuity and $11.5 as total.

Q4. (Sum the digits in an integer) Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and
1000 and adds all the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 932, the
sum of all its digits is 14.
Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the / operator to remove the
extracted digit. For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 / 10 = 93

Q5. (Find the number of years) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
minutes (e.g., 1 billion), and displays the number of years and days for the minutes.
For simplicity, assume a year has 365 days.

Q6: (Health application: computing BMI) Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of
health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and
dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the
user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI. Note
that one pound is 0.45359237	 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters.

Q7. (Geometry: distance of two points) Write a program that prompts the user to enter
two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays their distance between them.

Q8: (Print a table) Write a program that displays the following table. Cast floatingpoint
numbers into integers.
a 		b 		pow(a, b)
1 		2 		1
2 		3 		8
3 		4 		81
4 		5 		1024
5 		6 		15625
